	This sample showcases the Localization support in Spreadsheet Control. It allows you to set custom resources through a .resx file. Using this localization support, you can customize the string values in the resource file for a specific culture and set the culture in an application. The given string values are reflected in the Spreadsheet control and Spreadsheet Ribbon without affecting the code block.
