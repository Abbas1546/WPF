            This sample showcases the NestedChildExport capability of GridDataControl. The GridExcelConverter class provides support for exporting data from a GridDataControl to an Excel spreadsheet for verification and/or computation. This control copies the Grid's styles and formats to Excel automatically. The GridExcelConverter class is derived from GridExcelConverterBase. The XlsIO libraries are used to support the conversion of the GridDataControl contents to Excel.
