            This sample showcases the UnboundRow capability of GridDataControl. The GridDataControl supports the addition of extra rows in the view which will not affect the DataSource. Such additional rows are called UnboundRows as they do not belong to the data source. These unbound fields can be used, when you want to add some additional or custom information for GridDataControl.
