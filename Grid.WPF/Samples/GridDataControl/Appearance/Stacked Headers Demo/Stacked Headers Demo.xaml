			This sample showcases the Stacked headers capability of GridDataControl. The GridDataControl allows you to have additional unbound header rows called stacked header rows that span across visible grid columns. You can group one or more columns under each stacked header. Stacked header rows for a given grid are gathered under the Grid.StackedHeaderRow collection. This collection contains the property definitions that control the behavior and appearance of the stacked headers.
