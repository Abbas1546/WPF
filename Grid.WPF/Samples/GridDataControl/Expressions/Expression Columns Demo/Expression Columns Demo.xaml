		This sample showcases the ExpressionColumns capability of GridDataControl. Expression Fields enable you to add a column that holds calculated values based on other fields in the same record. These expression columns are created in the same way as any unbound column, by using the GridDataUnboundVisibleColumn class. This contains the Expression property which needs to be set with a non-null value for an expression column. Expressions can include arithmetic, logical, relational, and few string operators, which will finally get translated into LINQ expressions for evaluation.
