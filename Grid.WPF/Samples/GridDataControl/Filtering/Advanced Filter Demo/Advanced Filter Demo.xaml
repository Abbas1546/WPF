		This sample showcases the AdvancedFiltering capability of GridDataControl. This feature provides advanced filtering options for the end-user. It overrides the default filter and displays an advanced filter drop-down, which lists the available filter operators for the respective filtering column and provides a text box, where the user is allowed to type the filter string. It exhibits a dynamic filtering mechanism by applying filter as the characters are typed.
