		This sample showcases the Nested child Collection capability of GridDataControl. The GridDataControl can display nested tables in a hierarchy using a master-detail configuration. In a hierarchical view, all tables in the data source are interconnected by means of relations. The Grid automatically detects the data relations in a data set and creates a relation for each such data relation found in the data set and populates it in hierarchical view.
