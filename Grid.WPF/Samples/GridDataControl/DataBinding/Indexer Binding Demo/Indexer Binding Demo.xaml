			This sample showcases the Indexer binding capability of GridDataControl. Indexers in C# are a simple way to permit a class to be used like an array. The advantage of using indexers rather than exposing an array or generic list object is that internally, you can manage the values presented in any fashion you wish. This means that you can manage the array size, error handling and so forth with a lower likelihood of bugs.
