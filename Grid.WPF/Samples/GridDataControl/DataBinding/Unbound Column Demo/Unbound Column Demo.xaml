		This sample showcases the UnboundColumn capability of GridDataControl. The GridDataControl supports the addition of extra columns to the data source columns. Such additional columns are called unbound columns as they do not belong to the data source. These unbound fields can be used when you want to add some additional or custom information for each record. Unbound Column has two features like Expression and Format and these unbound fields are used when you want to add additional or custom information to each record. An unbound column is sorted, grouped, and filtered like other Grid Columns.
