            This sample showcases the Grouping capability of GridDataControl. The GridDataControl supports grouping which allows you to wrap a set of records that belong to the same category into a separate block, called a group. The GridDataControl enables you to group data by one or more columns. When grouping is applied, the records with identical values for the grouped columns will be combined together forming a hierarchical structure. Each group is identified by its group caption section that can be expanded to bring the underlying records into view.
