            This sample showcases the Custom Summaries capability of GridDataControl. The GridDataControl supports custom summaries with which you can impose custom calculation logic for deriving summary information. This is done by implementing the IGridDataSummaryAggregate interface to define the custom logic, and associating this custom logic to the SummaryColumn.CustomAggregate property. The IGridDataSummaryAggregate interface aids in building user-defined logic for summary calculation.
