This sample showcases the CustomizedCaptionSummary capability of GridDataControl. The GridDataControl provides built-in support for caption summaries, where the summary values are displayed in the group caption cells. You can have only one caption summary row for a grid table. The GridDataControl.CaptionSummaryRow property is used to set up a caption summary. The caption summary can be enabled/disabled by setting the ShowGroupSummaryInCaptionproperty as true/false.
