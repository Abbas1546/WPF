            This sample showcases the GridVisualStyle capabilities of GridDataControl. The GridDataControl implements visual styles that set up a common appearance for all the components in the grid. The term "Appearance" refers not only to the way the grid elements appear, but also the manner in which they behave in response to user interactions like mouse hovering, clicking, and so on.
