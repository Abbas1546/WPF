            This sample showcases the Default tooltip capability of GridDataControl. The GridDataControl features support for tooltips that correspond to individual cells. A tooltip is a small pop-up box that appears when you move the pointer over a visual element. It is used to display additional information about the elements without increasing the window size. They are mainly used to display some text data.
