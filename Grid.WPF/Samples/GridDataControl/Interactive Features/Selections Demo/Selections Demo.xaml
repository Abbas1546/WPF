In Record-based selection, the complete grid records (rows) will be selected and these selections function properly with nested tables, sorting, and so on. To use the record selections, you must set AllowSelections to none and then set ListBoxSelectionMode to any flag except none. Selection can be made through keyboard and mouse with some restriction.
