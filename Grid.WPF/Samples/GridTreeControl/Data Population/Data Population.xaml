GridTreeControl -Data Population
</Paragraph> 
<Paragraph>
    The GridTree control supports all popular data sources including ObservableCollections, DataTables, CollectionViewSource, BusinessObjects generated by the ADO.NET Entity Framework, LINQ to SQL or any other ORM.ADO.NET, DataView, ICollectionView, ObjectDataProvider, IEnumerable, IList, IBindingList, IQueryable, and ITypedList. Data can be bound to the GridTree control either by directly binding the ItemsSource with the relation info or by getting node elements dynamically with the RequestTreeItems event. Here are some samples that demonstrate how to bind different types of collections and objects to the GridTree control.
