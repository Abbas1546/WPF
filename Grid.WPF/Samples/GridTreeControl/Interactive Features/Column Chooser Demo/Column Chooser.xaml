            	This sample showcases the Column Chooser capabilities of GridTreeControl. The column chooser enables end users to include and exclude columns from the view at run time. This sample will have the column chooser in the form of a child window. The child window will display all the columns that exist in the bound source next to a check box. By selecting and deselecting the check boxes, the user can include or exclude the corresponding column from the view.
