This sample showcases the MinimalTree capabilities of GridTreeControl. The GridTreeControl is a grid that displays self-referencing lists in a multicolumn tree format. The data is loaded on demand so that large lists can be quickly displayed. Direct support for a classic tree look is provided, but it also gives you the ability to easily customize the look of the tree with special glyphs and icons. Exceptional performance is possible such that thousands of nodes can be expanded or collapsed instantaneously.
