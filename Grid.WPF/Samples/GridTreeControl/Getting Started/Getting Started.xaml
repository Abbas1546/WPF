GridTreeControl - Getting Started
</Paragraph> 
<Paragraph>
    Following sample that use the GridTreeControl, a derived GridControl that displays multicolumn tree data. The GridTreeControl is populated entirely by handling a single event where root and child items are provided on demand. This on-demand population allows the control to quickly display selected tree nodes from a large data source without fully loading all the data. 
</Paragraph> 

<Paragraph> <Bold>Minimal Tree Demo</Bold>- This sample shows the minimal XAML code requirements for displaying tree data. The underlying data source is a list of employees and the GridTreeControl displays them in a tree where the manager is the parent node and the employees that report to manager are the child nodes of the tree. </Paragraph>
