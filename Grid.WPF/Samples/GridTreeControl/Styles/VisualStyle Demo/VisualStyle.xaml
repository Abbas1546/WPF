            This sample showcases the VisualStyle capability of GridTreeControl. The GridTree control implements visual styles that set a common appearance to all the components in the tree grid. The visual styles not only affect the way the tree grid elements appear, but also the manner in which they behave in response to user interactions such as mouse hovering, clicking, and so on.
