<Paragraph>MACD is a momentum variation that compares two moving averages by subtracting them instead of dividing them. In addition, an average of this difference line is also displayed. This is an example of an oscillator type chart that oscillates above and below zero. The difference line crossing the zero line can be used as a signal. When the average line is above the difference line, this is a further bullish signal. </Paragraph>
