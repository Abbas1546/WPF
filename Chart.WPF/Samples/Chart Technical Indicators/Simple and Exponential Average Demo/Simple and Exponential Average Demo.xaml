        <Bold>Simple Average</Bold> computes an n-day simple average. It add up the most recent n day's closing prices and then divide this sum by n, commonly used values of n are 50 and 200. If the price is higher than its average, it is generally considered a bullish (positive) signal. When the price is below its average, then this is considered bearish. Additionally, rising averages are bullish and falling averages are bearish. If you plot two averages on a bar chart with one short term and the other long term, then the short term average crossing above the long term average is considered bullish and the opposite cross is considered bearish.

        <Bold>Exponential Average </Bold> computes an n-day exponential average. It computes a multiplier parameter by taking the n value and dividing it by two times n plus 1. On the first known day, the exponential average is the close for that day. On subsequent days, the exponential average is computed as the parameter times the close price plus one minus the parameter times the value of the average yesterday. The interpretations are the same as the simple average.

                The orange line in the sample shows an exponential average. Note that, unlike the simple average, it starts plotting at the last price of the first day of the chart.
