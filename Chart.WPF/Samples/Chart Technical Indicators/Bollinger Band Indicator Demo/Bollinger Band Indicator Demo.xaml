        Bollinger Band Indicator Demo
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        Bollinger Bands are two line charts, one drawn above the average and the other drawn below the average to form a band. The distance between the average and the bands is two times the standard deviation of the price. If the prices form a normal distribution about their average, the expectation is 95% of those prices to fall within this band. If prices are outside the band, this would be unusual and expected to see a price reversal in a short time.
