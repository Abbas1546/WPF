<Paragraph>
ListItemReference is an object reference relation for looking up values from a strong typed collection. Like ForeignKeyReference, it is also an n:1 relation where multiple records in the parent table can reference the same record in the related table. One difference between the ForeignKeyReference and ListItemReference is that the former uses a key to look up the values where as the later uses an object to look up the values in a nested collection.
